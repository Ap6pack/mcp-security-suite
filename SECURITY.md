# Security Policy

## Purpose and Scope

This document outlines the security policies for the MCP Security Tools Suite, an open-source collection of ethical hacking and security assessment tools.

## Responsible Use

### Legal and Ethical Guidelines

**IMPORTANT**: These tools are designed for authorized security testing only.

- **Always obtain explicit written permission** before testing any systems
- **Never use these tools for malicious purposes**
- **Follow responsible disclosure practices** when reporting vulnerabilities
- **Comply with all applicable laws and regulations** in your jurisdiction
- **Respect rate limits** and avoid causing service disruptions

### Authorized Testing Only

Before using these tools:
1. Ensure you have written authorization from the system owner
2. Define clear scope boundaries for your testing
3. Document all testing activities for audit purposes
4. Use the `AUTHORIZED_SCOPE` environment variable to enforce boundaries

## Security Considerations

### API Key Security

1. **Never commit API keys to version control**
   - Use `.env` files (excluded from git)
   - Store keys in environment variables
   - Use separate keys for development and production

2. **Rotate keys regularly**
   - Set reminders for key rotation
   - Revoke unused or compromised keys immediately
   - Monitor API usage for anomalies

### Data Protection

1. **Scan Results**
   - Store results in encrypted formats when possible
   - Implement proper access controls
   - Follow data retention policies
   - Sanitize results before sharing

2. **Target Information**
   - Never store credentials found during testing
   - Redact sensitive information in reports
   - Use secure channels for communication

### Operational Security

1. **Network Considerations**
   - Use VPN or proxy services when appropriate
   - Implement rate limiting to avoid detection/blocking
   - Respect target infrastructure limitations

2. **Tool Updates**
   - Keep tools updated with latest security patches
   - Review changelogs before updating
   - Test updates in isolated environments first

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability in this project:

### Do NOT:
- Open a public GitHub issue
- Exploit the vulnerability beyond proof of concept
- Share details publicly before a fix is available

### DO:
1. Create a private security advisory on GitHub
2. Include:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fixes (if any)

### Response Timeline:
- Initial response: Within 72 hours
- Status update: Within 1 week
- Target fix timeline: Based on severity

## Built-in Security Features

### Scope Enforcement
```python
# The tools validate targets against AUTHORIZED_SCOPE
AUTHORIZED_SCOPE = "example.com,192.168.1.0/24"
```

### Rate Limiting
- Configurable delays between requests
- Exponential backoff on errors
- Respect for robots.txt and rate limit headers

### Audit Logging
- All tool operations are logged
- Logs include timestamps and target information
- Logs exclude sensitive data by design

## Security Best Practices for Contributors

When contributing code:

1. **Input Validation**
   - Validate all user inputs
   - Use parameterized queries
   - Sanitize data before processing

2. **Error Handling**
   - Don't expose system information in errors
   - Log errors securely
   - Provide generic error messages to users

3. **Dependencies**
   - Keep dependencies minimal
   - Regular security audits with `safety` and `bandit`
   - Pin versions in requirements.txt

4. **Code Review**
   - All PRs require security review
   - Run security linters before committing
   - Test for common vulnerabilities

## Compliance Considerations

### GDPR and Privacy
- Tools should not store personal data
- Implement data minimization principles
- Support right-to-erasure requests

### Industry Standards
- Follow OWASP guidelines
- Align with NIST frameworks
- Support compliance reporting needs

## Security Tools Integration

This project integrates with:
- **Bandit**: For Python security linting
- **Safety**: For dependency vulnerability scanning
- **GitHub Security Advisories**: For vulnerability tracking
- **Dependabot**: For automated dependency updates

## Incident Response

In case of security incident:
1. Isolate affected systems
2. Preserve evidence for analysis
3. Notify affected parties responsibly
4. Document lessons learned
